CodePlaygroundInteractive (CPI) is a group dedicated to making clones of simple coding games to give them carbon copy versions to compare, edit, rewrite, or fix. This is helpful for building the Developer's JavaScript experience and do no harm. Scratch's brand is under the MIT license, which means Scratchin' is **NOT** part of a Copyright Area.
